Vagrant

# Vagrant versions

The vagrant in the ubuntu repos is a little out of date at the time of writting this (10/2013).  These vagrant files work against vagrant 1.3.3.  Go here to get an upto date version: http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.3.3 and then install it:

    sudo dpkg -i vagrant_1.3.3_x86_64.deb

This upgraded my vagrant install.

# Quick start

    vagrant up
